            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Thirty thousand dollars. She thumbed the sum in her mind.

            <p class="indent up">
                “Oh, honey.” She wrapped her arms around the base of his torso and he slunk his body deeper into their dusty couch, “I still don’t fully understand. I thought NFTs were non-fungible. Can’t you just get them back?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “They are. But once they’re transferred into another wallet-” he said softly, “There’s basically nothing I can do. Most transactions are available on the blockchain ledger, but once it reaches the address it’s-”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">

                They sat for a moment. He wallowed. She listened to the sound of his breathing.

                “This was supposed to be our new start. I was going to buy you that bed.”

            <p class="indent up">
                “Memory foam, California King, space-age technology developed by NASA. So your back stops hurting so much in the mornings.” She shifted her weight, “I’m sorry. I’m such a damned fool.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “You’re not a fool.”

                “It is a nice bike.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                When she agreed with him on these small things it always made him smile. And so, he smiled. He turned to kiss her and together they looked at the black road bike leaning against the wall. It was more a sculpture in this late-afternoon light than a bicycle. Hand laid carbon fiber frame, aerodynamic wheels, advanced wireless Japanese groupset, wind-tunnel tested handlebars, and the same handlebar tape used by famous cyclist Hansel Joy-Saint Malibu. The fastest man in the world on two wheels.

                “What if Dex was the one that took your cryptos and JPEGs?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “I’d have him flayed and I’d drag his body around town like Achilles did Hector.”

            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                At the door to their small apartment they kissed softly. He wheeled his bike through the hallway, carried it down the stairs, and started off into the warm day. She set to make herself a cup of coffee and looked up a few videos to better understand cryptocurrencies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="indent up">
                “They took all of it.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Dex choked on his coffee.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “They took all of it?” Dex shook his head, “All of it? All of it, all of it?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Outside, they mulled in silence. The two sipped on their coffees in unison. The day was unfortunately beautiful for such sad news. Dex enjoyed the air and the coffee was a delight.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “What did Val say?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “She just- She didn’t really know what to say.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Well, losing two million dollars of crypto- Of anything, really, is a fucking disaster. A calamity. You really look like the saddest bastard I’d seen.” He didn’t reply. “You didn’t tell her did you?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “I did. Just not-” He looked down into the dark void of his coffee. Seeing in his own reflection a tiredness and guilt.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Just not how much. Oh, Bradley boy. Fucking Bradley.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Fucking me. I told her it was just a few thousand.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “How did they do it?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “I had a small transaction in limbo from one of the on-ramps.”

                “BDx5M?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Bradley nodded.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “When this happened before, the transaction got flagged and manually approved. I just wanted to convert USD to BTC to Breast-Milk Token to buy an NFT from the Phat AZN Ass and Louis Vuitton collaboration collection while the prices are low. Hold it for awhile, make a shit ton of money on a swing. So I messaged their support account on LyttleByrd.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “You idiot. They don’t have a support account-”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “They don’t have a support account on LyttleByrd. They, whoever the fuck it was, the scammer asked to sync my wallet and- As soon as a synced I knew what was happening but they took it all by then.”

                Bradley nodded.

                “Everything.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">

                “I screamed like King Priam watching Hector’s body being dragged around the gates of Troy.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Lord Satoshi please help this small man. If I didn’t feel so sorry for you I’d steal your girlfriend and run away to the Alps. Buy a nice cabin in the woods and ski and study birds and fauna for the rest of my days.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Promise to buy her a memory foam mattress and I’d let you.”

            <p class="indent up">
                He held the lukewarm cup of coffee in his hands, lifting it to slowly sip every few minutes. He rested his arm on the seat of his bike, keeping it close the same way a small child does a blanket for comfort. Some time passed. The cafe cascaded with small parades of people floating in and out, the volume of the venue rising and falling like a tide. Dex reached into his bag and pulled out a pen and checkbook.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “I don’t want to do this, you know.”

            <p class="indent up">
                “I’m going to buy it back from you. As soon as I get my two million and more.”

            <p class="indent up">
                “I really, really don’t want to do this. I kind of want to do this.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Dex wrote casually onto the paper a small fortune of ten thousand dollars and signed his name in a simple and unfettered plain font. In the memo field he wrote “for REAL art”. He tore the check from the binding and held it to the warm air allowing the ink to dry. They both looked at the treasure as it shifted hands. Without seeing the sum, Bradley folded the piece of paper worth thousands of dollars in half and stuffed it into this back pocket.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “If this bounces I will drag your body around the city like Achilles’ Hector.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Scammed twice in one day? Only you, the Greatest of Geeks.” They both laughed. “Hey. What’s the difference between a piece of paper with some writing on it and digital currencies?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Nothing really.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Hmm. And, if you think about it, Dexter is kind of close to Hector.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “I’m a sad fool with nothing to lose. Don’t tempt me.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                They completed their date discussing strategies to make Bradley his money back. The general tone was that of determination and optimism. Once he finished his coffee, Dexter stood.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                “Are you going to watch me leave like an idiot thinking his life is a movie?”
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Dex mounted the black bike and straddled the top bar. He rested his hand on Bradley’s shoulder and then peddled away. His silhouette in the setting sun was something beautiful and the bike looked very fast. As fast as a scammer and as swift as a shadow. A fantastic shadow made out of carbon fiber and molded by the torrential winds of Everest’s peak. And as Dex turned the corner, never looking back, it was now an illusion conjured by the child-like despair of losing your favorite toy. He sighed something heavy and walked into the cafe. Bradley picked out a handsome loaf of sourdough and some french butter, paid for it at the register, and began walking back to Valerie.
